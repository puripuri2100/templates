    <p>
      Viola is an online editor for printing and publishing.
      By editing HTML and CSS, you can output your articles not only for the web but also for paper media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's learn how to edit with Viola easily.

      <h1>User Interface</h1>

      <p>
        In Viola editor, we create manuscripts by editing HTML files.
        <code>index.html</code> is prepared by the initial manuscript,
        and you can see the preview of this HTML file on the right side
        and the HTML file being edited on the left side.
        (This tutorial which you're looking at is also created by
        <code>index.html</code>!)
      </p>

      <p>
        A file tree is placed further to the left of the HTML edit panel.
        To edit multiple files, select a file from among them.
        You can also create new files and add existing files,
        so images and font data can be added if you want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to write the manuscript more easily,
        We suggest you try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>.
        If you create a file whose name ends with <code>.md</code>,
        An HTML file with the same name is automatically created.
        This file is synchronized with the content of Markdown,
        It will automatically be converted to HTML with the same content.

      <h1>Preview Mode</h1>
      <p>
        Next let's introduce the preview mode.
        There are three preview modes; a PC preview mode you are looking at,
        a mobile preview mode that can check the appearance on a smartphone,
        and a print preview mode that can check the appearance when printing.
        Let's select the print preview mode by clicking a button on the upper right for trial.
        When printing data is output, you can get the exact same PDF as this look.

      <h1>Printing</h1>

      <p>
        When your writing is completed, save the manuscripts for printing output.
        Select “Open the print page” from the gear button to open the preview screen.
        After that, you can print it with your printer, or save it in PDF and submit to a printing office, too!
